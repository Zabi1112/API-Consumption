IBackendEventsInterface.cs: Defines an interface with a single method, CallEvent, which takes a BackendEventType enum. This design suggests you have a system for triggering various backend-related events throughout your application.

ImageDownloadUtility.cs: Currently, this class doesn't implement functionality specific to image downloading. It's a template with Unity's standard Start and Update methods but without additional logic.

ApiUrls.cs: Stores constants related to API URLs. It looks like it's set up to toggle between different base URLs depending on whether you're in a test environment or production. It includes URLs for various API endpoints like user validation, token refresh, and user creation.

NetworkUtility.cs: Contains a collection of methods and utilities for network-related tasks, including subscribing to events, firing events, and checking internet availability. It seems to serve as a central hub for managing network events and callbacks.

ApiResponseUtility.cs: Provides methods for parsing API responses. It includes utility methods for converting JSON responses into C# models and handling common response structures and errors.

ApiCallHelper.cs: A MonoBehaviour that seems to facilitate making specific API calls like creating users, fetching user data, and refreshing tokens. It demonstrates using the UnityWebRequest for making GET and POST requests and handling the responses.

ApiHttpUtility.cs: Contains detailed implementations for making HTTP requests (GET, POST) with various content types (JSON, Form) and handling retries. This utility also queues API calls and manages headers, particularly for authentication.
